# Rick-n-Morty-Scene-Gen
## Rick &amp; Morty Script Generation with Huggingface Datasets and Anyscale fine-tuning

In this notebook we go through how to create an openAI compatable training payload for training a LlaMA model using anyscale endpoints. Then we look at how to generate completions from this newly fine-tuned model. Finally, we create a dialogue generator to enable Rick & Morty digital twins to talk to each other.

To run this notebook you will need an Anyscale API key, which you can get by creating an account [here]([url](https://app.endpoints.anyscale.com/)https://app.endpoints.anyscale.com/).
